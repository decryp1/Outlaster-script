# Outlaster-script
below is just me yapping about each feature, this is the funnest script i've ever made!
simple little script made with a little ChatGPT and overwhelming amounts of fireTouchInterest code LOL ;)
ChatGPT was used in the HttpGet related function(s), as i really have no experience with that LOL.
i saw only like 2 or 3 other scripts for this game, and i think i've made some unique features, including a Team Checker! and maybe a Hint Helper!?!?
this is what i used HttpGet for, to get everyones friends list, and then spit out who has who friended!
other than that, i'm thinking of making a helper for hints, as if you go into the ui for the hints, you see the compass part of the ui, since the arrow has to update everytime you move ---
i might make a thing that points you in the right direction. the Rotation section of the Arrow in the compass = 0 when you're facing it, so i was thinking, maybe make it just read that and update the arrow accordingly?
comment on my outlaster video when i make it for any recommendations, REASONABLE recommendations, i'll put it here and update it when i upload it! ("not uploaded yet 7/27/24")
all in all, this is only my 4th ever script, so the syntax may be off, but i try to let chatgpt help me with that lmao.
supports Wave, Solara, and any other cheat that has fireTouchInterest and HttpGet!
